- An example of a kernel driver function hook.
- DETECTED (by most anti cheats)
- Hooks NtQueryCompositionSurfaceStatistics

- If you were to find an alternative fuction to hook it would probably be undetected
- Sign with and edited version KDMapper (iqvw64e.sys is detected) 

# TODO
- Finish the userMode
- Bypass detection vectors (clear strings, etc.)
